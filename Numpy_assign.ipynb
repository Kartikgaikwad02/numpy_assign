        "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package in Python for scientific computing. Its primary purpose is to provide support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The advantages of using NumPy include:\n",

        "Handling Uneven Splits\n",

        "1. Vectorization\n",
        "Concept: Vectorization in NumPy refers to the ability to perform operations on entire arrays or matrices without the need for explicit loops. Instead of iterating through elements one by one, NumPy performs operations in a more efficient, optimized manner using low-level implementations.\n",

        "How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Underlying Implementation: NumPy operations are implemented in C and Fortran, which are much faster than Python loops due to optimized memory handling and lower-level computations.\n",
        "Operations on Arrays: When you perform operations on NumPy arrays, they apply element-wise operations efficiently without the need for manual looping.\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance: Vectorized operations are typically much faster than using Python loops because they utilize efficient, low-level implementations.\n",
        "Readability: Code is more concise and easier to read, as operations are applied to entire arrays or matrices in a single line.\n",
        "Optimization: NumPy's internal optimization reduces the overhead of Python's dynamic typing and loop control.\n",

        "2. Broadcasting\n",
        "Concept: Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism in NumPy that allows operations between arrays of different shapes. It automatically adjusts the dimensions of the arrays to make their shapes compatible for element-wise operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rules for Broadcasting:\n",
        "Align Dimensions: Starting from the rightmost dimensions, the dimensions of the arrays are compared. Arrays are aligned by adding dimensions of size 1 where necessary.\n",
        "Shape Compatibility: Arrays are broadcasted to match each other's shapes if their dimensions are either equal or one of them is 1.\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Broadcasting allows for operations between arrays of different shapes, reducing the need to manually reshape or expand arrays.\n",
